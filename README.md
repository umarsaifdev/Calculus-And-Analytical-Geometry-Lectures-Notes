# 📘 Calculus & Analytic Geometry 

Welcome to the *Calculus & Analytic Geometry Notes* — designed for Computer Science & AI students who want to finally understand math in simple words.  

## Why this repo exists  
Most students struggle with Calculus because it feels abstract, overloaded with formulas, and disconnected from real life. This repo fixes that.  
I’ve modified these notes using the **Richard Feynman Technique** — breaking down complex concepts into plain, simple language so you can explain them as if teaching a friend.  

## What you’ll find here  
- ✅ Lecture notes (PDFs, step-by-step)  
- ✅ Concepts simplified with the Feynman method  
- ✅ Direct links to video lectures for Urdu/Hindi Speakers 
- ✅ A roadmap from the basics → advanced  

## Who this is for  
- Students in CS, AI, and Engineering  
- Self-learners tired of “rote learning”  
- Anyone who wants to *finally* build intuition in math  

## How to use this repo  
1. Watch the lecture video if you are an Urdu/Hindi Speaker 🎥  
2. Download the PDF notes 📘  
3. Follow along, pause, and review  
4. Try explaining the concept in your own words (Feynman style)  
5. Apply the concepts to problems in your field  

💡 *This isn’t just math. It’s the foundation of computer science and AI, explained the way you wish someone had taught you.*
